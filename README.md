<h1>Hillel IT School</h1>
<h2>Front-end Basic</h2>
There I learned how to translate designs
of any complexity into layout, make
websites that display equally well on any
device, notice important little things and
write code that is easy to expand and
maintain, understand the structure of
web pages.
